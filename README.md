# CSCE 689 Fall 2022 Semester Project

By Bryant Passage and Jesse Phipps

Stockfish-aided immitation learning self-play with deep neural networks applied to chess.

Before running, create a conda environment with the provided env.yml by running **conda env create -f env.yml**

To train a model, modify the arguments within train_agent.py and execute the file from your terminal with **python train_engine689.py**. This will create a model in the models/ folder to be used in your engine for chess play.

A special thanks to [chess-alpha-zero](https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero), [AlphaZeroSimple](https://github.com/JoshVarty/AlphaZeroSimple), and [Ish2k](https://github.com/Ish2K/Chess-Bot-AI-Algorithms/blob/main/Git_chess/monte_carlo_implementation.py) for their library's inspirations for this project.
